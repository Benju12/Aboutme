  <h2>All about me!</h2>
  <p> Hey everyone! My name is Ben and I just recently graduated from highschool and will graduate from RCC in August. I will be attending JMU in the fall this year and plan on getting a Bachlors in Computer Science, then get my Masters in Cybersecurity! I plan on using this course as an introduction to Coding so when I go to JMU the coding part of it will not be too foreign.</p>
